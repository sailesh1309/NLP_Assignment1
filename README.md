# NLP_Assignment1
# Hi professor this is Sailesh , I  have placed all the python scripts i.e., .py files in one folder named Sailesh_HW1. 
# I have written individual codes  for every module and added different function in each module. 
# Every module is imported in driver.py module and created a input text with some valid text and then called every function from each module by calling driver.py by going to the directory where I have saved all the files.
# In Sailesh_HW1 we have all the files , by using command prompt I have called driver.py in order to call the input and get the output by using input.txt and it displays the output in command prompt.
